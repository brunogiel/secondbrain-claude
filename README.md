# SecondBrain

Claude starts every session without knowing who you are, how you work, or where the important stuff lives. SecondBrain gives it a plain-text folder to read at startup, so it stops guessing.

It is not a second brain for you to read. It is a folder your assistant can operate from.

You install one coach. The coach helps you build the rest one step at a time. It works with **Cowork** and **Claude Code**. **Codex** and other agents can use the same folder through `AGENTS.md`.

> Method content is in Spanish (rioplatense). Spanish version: [README.es.md](README.es.md).

---

## Why it works

The model writes text. The client (Cowork, Claude Code, Codex) gives it hands to read and edit files. Your folder gives it context: who you are, what projects exist, what rules to follow, and where to look.

You feel the difference in the second session: you do not have to explain the same context again.

## Install

### Cowork (no terminal)

1. In the **Customize** panel, under **Personal plugins**, click **+** and choose **Create plugin -> Add marketplace**. Paste: `brunogiel/secondbrain-claude`
   (shortcut if you can type: `/plugin marketplace add brunogiel/secondbrain-claude`).
2. Install the **secondbrain** plugin
   (or type `/plugin install secondbrain@secondbrain-claude`).
3. Open or create the folder where your brain should live. A synced folder is best: Drive, iCloud, or Dropbox.
4. Open or create the folder where your brain should live (a synced folder: Drive, iCloud, Dropbox).
5. Use one of:
   - `/second-brain-setup` — initial configuration (idempotent, safe to run again)
   - `/second-brain-coach` — the full coach: locates you and proposes the next step
   - `/escalera` — check your progress on the ladder at any time

The coach asks before creating files. It does not build folders behind your back. In Cowork, the plugin updates itself.

### Claude Code

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brunogiel/secondbrain-claude/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then open the folder where you want to work and type:

```text
/second-brain-setup   # initial setup (idempotent)
/second-brain-coach   # full coach: locates you + proposes next step
/escalera             # check your progress anytime
```

The script installs the method and commands globally. It does not touch your brain folder.

## What gets installed

There are two parts:

- **The method:** lives outside your folder. In Cowork, it is a plugin. In Claude Code, it lives in `~/.claude/skills/`. This is where the coach, templates, and kit catalog live.
- **Your brain:** lives in your synced folder. This is where your files, projects, identity, and adopted skills live.

The user's final folder looks like this:

```text
CLAUDE.md
ESTADO.md
ESCALERA.md
AGENTS.md
0. Inbox/
1. Proyectos/
2. Areas/yo/
3. Recursos/
4. Archivo/
skills/
```

The `kit/` directory belongs to the method, not to the final brain. In this repo it is split like this:

- `kit/brain/`: templates for the base brain folder.
- `kit/skills/`: catalog of skills the coach can activate one at a time.

## Already have a system?

You do not have to migrate. The coach reads your structure and keeps it.

The rule is simple: there must be a clear router (`CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`) that says where things live. If your structure already works, the coach does not rename it or force PARA. It only proposes small improvements: inbox, shortcuts, decision logs, skills, or session state.

## What it touches

- The Claude Code installer only installs the global method.
- The coach creates files in your brain only after you approve.
- Existing files are not overwritten.
- Updates refresh the method, not your folder.
- Uninstall removes the engine, not your data.

In Claude Code:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brunogiel/secondbrain-claude/main/uninstall.sh | SB_YES=1 bash
```

In Cowork, uninstall the plugin from the UI or type:

```text
/plugin uninstall secondbrain
```

## The ladder

You do not build everything on day one. You climb one step at a time.

| Level | What you build | What it gives you |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | Identity + inbox | The assistant knows who you are and loose ideas are not lost |
| **1** | First project with `CLAUDE.md` | You stop re-explaining context and decisions |
| **2** | Phrase -> folder shortcuts | Say "my expenses" and it knows where to look |
| **3** | First custom skill | One phrase triggers a repeated recipe |
| **4** | Routine + connected tool | The system can read mail, calendar, or tasks |
| **5** | Orchestrator | Several skills work together |
| **6** | Audit and tuning | You keep the system from degrading |
| **If you code** | Code separated from context | The repo keeps code; the brain keeps decisions |

The coach reads `ESTADO.md` and `ESCALERA.md`, tells you where you are, and proposes one next step.

## Portability

Your brain is plain text. You can open the same folder in Cowork, Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor.

Use-skills live in `skills/` and are activated through the **Mis skills** table in `CLAUDE.md`. Codex and Cursor reach that table through `AGENTS.md`.

The only Claude-specific piece is the setup engine: `/second-brain-coach` and, in Claude Code, `actualizar`. If you use another agent, `AGENTS.md` includes a fallback workflow.

## What's inside

- `CLAUDE.md`: main router.
- `ESTADO.md`: short status file for resuming quickly.
- `ESCALERA.md`: progress tracker and kit catalog.
- `AGENTS.md`: pointer for non-Claude agents.
- `0. Inbox/`: capture without deciding.
- `2. Areas/yo/sobre-mi.md`: who you are.
- `2. Areas/yo/como-trabajo.md`: how you want the assistant to work.
- `2. Areas/yo/mi-estilo.md`: your writing voice.
- `2. Areas/yo/MEMORIA.md`: facts that apply everywhere.
- `3. Recursos/arquitectura-skills.md`: how to build skills.
- `3. Recursos/anti-slop-writing.md`: rules for cleaning AI-sounding text.
- `skills/`: skills you have activated.

Available catalog skills:

- `redactar`: writes in your voice.
- `anti-slop`: cleans text.
- `crear-skill`: builds a new skill.
- `evaluar-skill`: checks a skill against its own rubric.
- `auditar-sistema`: checks the health of the brain.
- `triage`: builds a daily brief from connected mail, calendar, and tasks.
- `ppt-builder`: coordinates a communication piece in stages.
- `panel`: brings several lenses to a text, proposal, or document.

## Philosophy

- Propose, you decide.
- One step at a time.
- Small files, read only when needed.
- Skills stay dormant until a phrase activates them.
- Your folder stays clean: only your stuff.
